# The Clay and the Crown
## *Carve your name onto the clay of history*

### Description
*The Clay and the Crown* is an interactive website game that immerses users in the daily life and culture of ancient civilizations. We aim to foster historical awareness in users and encourage them to reflect on the enduring impacts of history. Even though technology is advancing, our society and government still face the same problems that caused the fall of some of these civilizations; hence, history is relevant for us to progress as a nation. This project makes history experiential to allow users to feel what it was like to live as a citizen in these civilizations through a narrative-driven simulation rather than simply presenting facts. 

The webpage follows a **life simulation** format, inspired by storytelling game advertisements on social media such as "Your Life as a ____". Upon entering the website, the user plays an ordinary citizen (e.g., a farmer in the Nile River, a scribe in Sumer, or an artisan in the Zhou Dynasty) and progresses through various stages of their life, set within true-to-life historical contexts. Each phase reveals aspects of the user's chosen civilization's traditions, daily routines, rituals, beliefs, architectural achievements, artistic achievements, and historical contributions.

### Topic Outline
1. Main Page: The main page shall be the home site for navigation of other webpages, a concise description of the website, and what to expect from using it.  The navigation will be done through a table in the main page and webpages.  All of the civilization webpages will feature contributions and important inventions, along with their cultures, rituals, and other important aspects of the civilizations.  
2. About Us Page: This page will just feature the makers of the page, goals of the website, insights towards the other topics, and some main sources.  It will be located near the header of the main page.  Will also site emails and github usernames.

5. Mesopotamia Page: The webage for Mesopotamia will feature its earliest empires, contributions in mathematics, and their breakthroughs in government and law.



### JavaScript Integration
We will use JavaScript so that the users can select the civilizations they want to explore, for decision-based branching, and for progress tracking to allow users to undergo through a personalised gaming experience. **These can be found in the Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, and Mesopotamia pages of the website.** Also, we plan to use JavaScript for an interactive story progression that allow users to scroll, click, or make decisions which dynamically change the content on-screen. For instance, as users progress through different life stages in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, or China, we will be able to incorporate scene transitions, animations, and sound effects that mirror their environment. This makes the webpage feel alive and responsive rather than static.
